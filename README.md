## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of crime in Los Angeles over a four-year period (2020 to 2023). Using a robust dataset provided by the Los Angeles Open Data Portal, our team has developed extensive visualizations to highlight crime trends, demographic impacts, and the effectiveness of law enforcement responses. The goal is to provide actionable insights for crime prevention and law enforcement strategies in Los Angeles.

## Data Source
The primary data for this project comes from the [Los Angeles Open Data Portal](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). This dataset consists of approximately 900,000 crime incidents, detailed across 29 columns, including timestamps, crime types, victim demographics, and geographical coordinates.

## Key Questions Explored
- **Geographic Distribution**: Where are the highest crime rates in Los Angeles?
- **Temporal Trends**: How have crime rates changed over the years and what are the peak times for crimes?
- **Crime Categories**: What are the prevalent types of crimes and their resolution rates?
- **Demographic Analysis**: How do crime patterns vary with respect to gender and age of the victims?

## Visualizations
Each visualization is designed to answer specific research questions:
- **Choropleth Maps**: Show the distribution of crime rates across different neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
- **Bar Charts**: Display temporal trends, illustrating how crime rates vary by month and year.
- **Tree Maps**: Used to represent the proportion of different types of crimes within the dataset.
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Analyze the resolution status of crimes to understand which types are most likely to remain unresolved.

## Data Preprocessing
Detailed steps involved in the preprocessing of data:
1. **Null Value Removal**: Used Python scripts to identify and eliminate records with missing information.
2. **Date Formatting**: Standardized date and time formats to align with Tableau's requirements.
3. **Geographic Normalization**: Adjusted latitude and longitude data to accurately reflect locations within the designated boundaries of Los Angeles.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau** for data visualization
- **Python** for data cleaning and preparation

## Final Output
The final dashboard provides a comprehensive view of crime trends, patterns, and insights. Below is a screenshot of the final dashboard:
